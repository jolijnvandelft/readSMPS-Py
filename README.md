## Description:

readSMPS: A package for evaluating the recourse function in two-stage stochastic programs

-  In this project the focus is on the evaluation part of the 2-stage stochastic programs
-  where the first stage variables are fixed and the goal is to estimate the recourse function 
-  based on the samples taken from the random variables(on the right hand side of the second stage problem)
-  and fixed first stage variables

------------------

## Dependencies:

- This package needs the Gurobi solver for optimization parts. https://www.gurobi.com/
